## Purpose
The main goal of the project was to create a website with mutliplayers pong game, and tournament system, in single-page-application. 
To validate the project, we had to choose 7 major modules. A major module could be replaced by two minor modules.
### Modules we chose:

  The user should be able to create an account, register for tournaments, add friends, update their informations and their profile picture. We also had to implement a user matchs history.<br>
- <strong>Implement a remote authentication<br></strong>
  The user should be able to subscribe with 42 OAuth 2.0 authentication.
- <strong>Remote players<br></strong>
  The users should be able to play with other players on different computers.
- <strong>Multiple players</strong><br>
  It is possible to have more than two players on a game.
- <strong>Add Another Game with User History and Matchmaking</strong>
- <strong>Implement Advanced 3D Techniques<br></strong>
  All games on the website should be built using threeJS.
- <strong>Live chat<br></strong>
  This one, worked like a basic chat, it allowed the user to send and receive message, games invitations and block other users.
- <strong>Use django for the backend<br></strong>
